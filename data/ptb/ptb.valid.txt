 yesterday 's selling began after a japanese news agency reported that japanese banks which balked at the first bid were ready to reject a revised version at around $ N a share or $ N billion 
 several reports as the day <unk> gave vague or <unk> indications about whether banks would sign up 
 citicorp for example said only that it had <unk> of interest of a transaction from both the borrowers and the banks but did n't have an agreement

 right away you notice the following things about a philip glass concert 
 it attracts people with funny hair or with no hair in front of me a girl with <unk> <unk> sat <unk> a boy who had <unk> his 
 whoever constitute the local left bank come out in force dressed in black along with a <unk> of <unk> who want to be on the cutting edge 
 people in glass houses tend to look <unk> 
 and if still <unk> at the evening 's end you notice something else the audience at first <unk> and <unk> by the music releases its <unk> feelings in collective <unk> 
 currently in the middle of a <unk> <unk> tour as a solo <unk> mr. glass has left behind his <unk> equipment and <unk> in favor of going it alone 
 he sits down at the piano and plays 
 and plays 
 either one likes it or one does n't 
 the typical glass audience which is more likely to be composed of music students than their teachers certainly does 
 the work though sounds like <unk> for <unk> 
 philip glass is the <unk> and his music the new clothes of the <unk> 
 his success is easy to understand 
 <unk> introducing and explaining his pieces mr. glass looks and sounds more like a <unk> <unk> describing his work than a classical <unk> playing a recital 
 the piano <unk> which have been labeled <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> cyclical <unk> and <unk> are <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> <unk> <unk> therefore <unk> and <unk> <unk> but <unk> therefore both pretty and <unk> 
 it is music for people who want to hear something different but do n't want to work especially hard at the task 
 it is <unk> listening for the now generation 
 mr. glass has <unk> the famous <unk> <unk> less is more 
 his more is always less 
 far from being <unk> the music <unk> <unk> us with apparent <unk> not so <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of N time <unk> <unk> and <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 but the music has its <unk> and mr. glass has constructed his solo program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex 
 opening N from <unk> <unk> the audience to the glass technique never <unk> too far from the piano 's center mr. glass works in the two <unk> on either side of middle c and his fingers seldom leave the <unk> 
 there is a <unk> musical style here but not a particular performance style 
 the music is not especially <unk> indeed it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it 
 nothing <unk> no <unk> no <unk> <unk> problems challenge the performer 
 we hear we may think inner voices but they all seem to be saying the same thing 
 with planet news music meant to <unk> <unk> of allen <unk> 's wichita <unk> <unk> mr. glass gets going 
 his hands sit <unk> apart on the <unk> 
 seventh <unk> make you feel as though he may break into a very slow <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> but there is little <unk> even though his fingers begin to <unk> over more of the <unk> 
 contrasts predictably <unk> first the music is loud then it becomes soft then you realize it becomes <unk> again 
 the fourth <unk> play an <unk> from <unk> on the beach is like a <unk> but it does n't seem to move much beyond its <unk> ground in three blind mice 
 when mr. glass decides to get really fancy he <unk> his hands and hits a <unk> bass note with his right hand 
 he does this in at least three of his solo pieces 
 you might call it a <unk> or a <unk> <unk> 
 in mad rush which came from a commission to write a piece of <unk> length mr. glass <unk> and <unk> confessed that this was no problem for me an a <unk> with a b section several times before the piece ends <unk> 
 not only is the typical <unk> <unk> it is also often multiple in its context s 
 mad rush began its life as the <unk> to the <unk> lama 's first public address in the u.s. when mr. glass played it on the <unk> at new york 's <unk> of st. john the <unk> 
 later it was performed on radio <unk> in germany and then <unk> <unk> took it for one of her dance pieces 
 the point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything 
 the evening ended with mr. glass 's <unk> another multiple work 
 parts N N and N come from the <unk> of <unk> morris 's <unk> film the thin blue line and the two other parts from <unk> music to two separate <unk> of the <unk> story of the same name 
 when used as background in this way the music has an appropriate <unk> as when a <unk> phrase a <unk> minor third <unk> the seemingly endless <unk> of reports interviews and <unk> of witnesses in the morris film 
 served up as a solo however the music lacks the <unk> provided by a context within another medium 
 <unk> of mr. glass may agree with the critic richard <unk> 's sense that the N music in twelve parts is as <unk> and <unk> as the <unk> <unk> 
 but while making the obvious point that both <unk> develop variations from themes this comparison <unk> the intensely <unk> nature of mr. glass 's music 
 its supposedly <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> that makes one <unk> for the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the <unk> radical <unk> of <unk> and <unk> and what in <unk> even seems like <unk> in <unk>

 the company would n't disclose the buyer of the initial N N stake 
 proceeds of the sale expected to be completed next week would be used to repurchase as many as N million shares of honeywell stock the company said 
 honeywell said it is negotiating the sale of a second stake in <unk> but indicated it intends to hold at least N N of the joint venture 's stock long term 
 a N N stake would allow honeywell to include <unk> earnings in its results 
 honeywell previously said it intended to reduce its holding in the japanese concern as part of a restructuring plan which also calls for a reduction of <unk> on weapons sales 
 yesterday a spokeswoman said the company was pleased with our progress in that regard and hopes to provide additional details soon 
 honeywell said its defense and marine systems group incurred delays in shipping some undisclosed contracts during the third quarter resulting in lower operating profit for that business 
 overall honeywell reported earnings of $ N million or $ N a share for the three months ended oct. N compared with a loss of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the previous period 's results included a $ N million pretax charge related to <unk> contract costs and a $ N million pretax gain on real estate sales 
 sales for the latest quarter were flat at $ N billion

 once again your editorial page <unk> the law to conform to your almost <unk> <unk> 
 in an <unk> of little <unk> to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups michael s. <unk> <unk> your readers the clean water act is written upon the <unk> the <unk> rather that nothing but zero risk will do it <unk> a legal standard of zero <unk> <unk> environmental <unk> sept.

 this statement surely <unk> your editorial viewpoint that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive but it is simply wrong 
 the clean water act contains no legal standard of zero <unk> 
 it requires that <unk> of <unk> into the waters of the united states be authorized by permits that reflect the <unk> limitations developed under section N 
 whatever may be the problems with this system it <unk> reflects zero risk or zero <unk> 
 perhaps mr. <unk> was confused by congress 's <unk> statement of the national goal in section N which indeed calls for the elimination of <unk> by N no less 
 this <unk> statement was not taken seriously when enacted in N and should not now be confused with the <unk> provisions of the statute 
 thus you do the public a great <unk> when mr. <unk> suggests even <unk> that the clean water act prohibits the preparation of a <unk> and water your <unk> readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them as they <unk> in the night with their <unk> and waters from the <unk> knock of the sierra club at their doors 
 robert j. <unk> 
 national geographic the <unk> u.s. magazine is attracting more readers than ever and offers the glossy <unk> pages that upscale advertisers love 
 so why did advertising pages plunge by almost N N and ad revenue by N N in the first half 
 to hear advertisers tell it the magazine just has n't kept up with the times 
 despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the third world it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to <unk> through in search of <unk> tribe women 
 worse it lagged behind competitors in offering <unk> <unk> from regional editions to discounts for frequent advertisers 
 but now the magazine is attempting to fight back with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign 
 advertisers do n't think of the magazine first says joan <unk> who joined in april as national advertising director 
 what we want to do is take a more aggressive stance 
 people did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace and in many ways we were n't 
 the <unk> magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much <unk> before 
 it largely <unk> on its <unk> <unk> N million subscribers in the first half up from N million a year ago an average age of N for readers at the <unk> of their <unk> years loyalty to the tune of an N N average subscription renewal rate 
 the magazine had its best year yet in N when it <unk> its centennial and racked up a N N gain in ad pages to N 
 but this year when the <unk> surrounding its centennial died so too did some advertiser interest 
 the reason ad executives say is that the entire magazine business has been soft and national geographic has some <unk> that make it especially <unk> during a soft market 
 perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices $ N for a <unk> page vs. $ N for the <unk> a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation 
 when ad dollars are tight the high page cost is a major <unk> for advertisers who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all 
 even though national geographic offers far more readers than does a magazine like <unk> the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any frequency says harry glass new york media manager for bozell inc 
 to combat that problem national geographic like other magazines began offering regional editions allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines for example ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest N markets 
 but the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional editions and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors 
 time magazine for example has more than N separate editions going to different regions top management and other groups 
 another sticking point for advertisers was national geographic 's tradition of <unk> its ads together usually at the beginning or end of the magazine rather than spreading ads out among its articles as most magazines do 
 and national geographic 's <unk> size means extra production costs for advertisers 
 but ms. <unk> says the magazine is fighting back 
 it now offers N regional editions it very recently began running ads adjacent to articles and it has been <unk> up its sales force 
 and it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives marketing directors and media executives just that 
 the centerpiece of the promotion is its new ad campaign into which the magazine will pour about $ N mostly in the next few weeks 
 the campaign created by <unk> group 's ddb needham agency takes advantage of the <unk> photography that national geographic is known for 
 in one ad a photo of the interior of the <unk> in paris is <unk> with the headline the only book more respected than <unk> does n't accept advertising 
 another ad pictures a tree <unk> magnified N times with the headline for impact far beyond your size consider our regional editions 
 ms. <unk> says she wants the campaign to help attract advertisers in N categories including corporate financial services consumer electronics insurance and food 
 her goal to top N ad pages in N up from about N this year 
 whether she can meet that ambitious goal is still far from certain 
 the ad campaign is meant to <unk> the thought of national geographic she says 
 we want it to be a <unk> kind of image

 the commodity futures trading commission plans to restrict dual trading on commodity exchanges a move almost certain to <unk> exchange officials and traders 
 the cftc said it will propose the restrictions after the release of a study that shows little economic benefit resulting from dual trading and cites problems associated with the practice 
 dual trading gives an exchange trader the right to trade both for his own account and for customers 
 the issue exploded this year after a federal bureau of investigation operation led to charges of widespread trading abuses at the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange 
 while not specifically mentioned in the fbi charges dual trading became a focus of attempts to tighten industry regulations 
 critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders 
 traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders 
 the exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand 
 the exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for <unk> traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration 
 the cftc may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions 
 the agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them 
 wendy <unk> the agency 's chairman told the senate agriculture committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by <unk> 
 the study by the cftc 's division of economic analysis shows that a trade is a trade a member of the study team said 
 whether a trade is done on a dual or <unk> basis the member said does n't seem to have much economic impact 
 currently most traders on commodity exchanges specialize in trading either for customer accounts which makes them brokers or for their own accounts as <unk> <unk> 
 the tests indicate that dual and <unk> traders are similar in terms of the trade executions and liquidity they provide to the market mrs. <unk> told the senate panel 
 members of congress have proposed restricting dual trading in bills to <unk> cftc operations 
 the house 's bill would prohibit dual trading in markets with daily average volume of N contracts or more <unk> those considered too difficult to track without a sophisticated computer system 
 the senate bill would force the cftc to suspend dual trading if an exchange ca n't show that its oversight system can detect <unk> abuses 
 so far one test of restricting dual trading has worked well 
 the chicago merc banned dual trading in its standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures pit in N 
 under the rules traders decide before a session begins whether they will trade for their own account or for customers 
 traders who stand on the pit 's top step where most customer orders are executed ca n't trade for themselves 
 a merc spokesman said the plan has n't made much difference in liquidity in the pit 
 it 's too soon to tell but people do n't seem to be unhappy with it he said 
 he said he would n't comment on the cftc plan until the exchange has seen the full proposal 
 but at a meeting last week tom <unk> the board of trade 's president told commodity lawyers dual trading is definitely worth saving 
 it adds something to the market 
 japanese firms push <unk> car <unk> 
 japanese luxury-car makers are trying to set strict design standards for their dealerships 
 but some dealers are negotiating <unk> terms while others decline to deal at all 
 nissan motor co. 's infiniti division likes to insist that every dealer construct and <unk> a building in a japanese style 
 specifications include a <unk> <unk> <unk> at the center of each showroom and a <unk> bridge <unk> a stream that flows into the building from outside 
 infiniti has it down to the <unk> says jay <unk> a partner at <unk> power & associates an auto research firm 
 toyota motor corp. 's lexus division also provides specifications 
 but only two-thirds of lexus dealers are <unk> new buildings according to the lexus <unk> 
 some are even coming up with their own novel designs 
 in louisville ky. for example david peterson has built a lexus dealership with the showroom on the second floor 
 yet some dealers have turned down infiniti or lexus <unk> because they were unwilling or unable to meet the design requirements 
 lee seidman of cleveland says infiniti was a bear on <unk> but at least let him <unk> an existing building without the stream 
 mr. seidman says he turned down a lexus franchise in part because the building was <unk> but very expensive 
 to head off arguments infiniti offers dealers cash bonuses and <unk> construction loans 
 <unk> device 's <unk> plays back a lesson 
 products <unk> have to be first to be winners 
 that 's the lesson offered through one case study featured in a design exhibit 
 dictaphone corp. was caught off guard in N when its main competitor <unk> office products of japan introduced a <unk> <unk> recorder half the size of standard <unk> devices 
 blocked by patent protection from following suit dictaphone decided to go a step further and cut the <unk> in half again down to the length of a <unk> 
 by N designers and engineers at dictaphone a pitney bowes subsidiary had produced a working model of a <unk> recorder 
 by N however the patent status of the <unk> <unk> had changed permitting dictaphone to develop its own competitive micro system which it did 
 marketing and sales departments then urged <unk> of the <unk> project 
 but others said <unk> should proceed 
 both were right 
 dictaphone went ahead and introduced the <unk> in N but it has n't sold well 
 to date says <unk> <unk> a dictaphone vice president it has broken even or shown a small loss 
 nevertheless the device has been successful in other ways 
 it helped dictaphone attract better engineers and it provided new technology for other company products 
 the <unk> recorder also helped transform the company 's reputation from <unk> to <unk> <unk> 
 it gave me great pride to see the inventor of the <unk> in japan look at the <unk> and shake his head and say <unk> says mr. <unk> 
 dictaphone 's <unk> recorder is one of N case studies in the <unk> design project sponsored by the design management institute of boston and harvard business school 
 the studies are on exhibit at harvard this month and will travel to chicago 's institute of design and the university of california at berkeley 
 a rake 's progress means <unk> out 
 one day carl barrett of mobile ala. was <unk> some <unk> leaves but the rake kept riding up over the <unk> 
 the harder he tried to push them into large <unk> the closer he came to breaking the rake and <unk> his back 
 so mr. barrett then vice president of the alabama <unk> association took a <unk> garden rake and taped it to the <unk> of a <unk> rake about nine inches up 
 his crude device worked the lower teeth gathered the leaves into a pile while the higher harder teeth moved the top of the pile 
 now incorporated into a <unk> rake the <unk> <unk> or <unk> also are supposed to aid in picking up leaves 
 one customer donald <unk> of mobile says the barrett rake allowed him to do his lawn in N N hours two hours less than usual 
 but other rake makers have their doubts 
 richard mason president of <unk> co. in <unk> w. va. says the barrett rake makes sense but it would be tough to explain to consumers 
 john <unk> marketing director for true <unk> corp. a subsidiary of black & decker says people do n't want to move a <unk> pile 
 they either pick it up he says or they start pulling from a fresh direction 
 odds and ends 
 no more <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> promises <unk> corp. of <unk> ind. the designer of a bed support to replace traditional <unk> 
 four <unk> steel <unk> each roughly in the shape of a <unk> are attached to the bottom of the box spring in a <unk> position 
 nearly half of u.s. consumers say they 'll pay up to N N more for packaging that can be recycled or is <unk> according to a survey commissioned by the michael peters group a design consultant 
 the pentagon is a <unk> house 
 living there for six years was really scary 
 the ghosts of the past are everywhere they are kept at bay only by feeding them vast quantities of our defense budget 
 some can be bought off relatively <unk> 
 during the korean war gen. douglas <unk> demanded and got in addition to his u.n. command in korea his own naval command in japan <unk> 
 those <unk> operations cost less than $ N billion a year and keep mac 's ghost quiet 
 that 's about all it costs to <unk> adm. erich <unk> 's ghost 
 in N <unk> and the german navy threatened to attack the panama <unk> so we created the southern command in panama 
 the southern command has grown even bigger since the war because <unk> 's ghost sometimes runs through the e ring dressed like gen. noriega 
 the command 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of coups against gen. noriega meet the war powers act 's six points cap <unk> 's seven points the intelligence committee 's N points and <unk> wilson 's N points necessary to justify u.s. support 
 so far no one has 
 the ghost of the soviet <unk> discovered in cuba back in the <unk> costs just a few hundred million the price of the caribbean command in key west that president carter created in N 
 the <unk> has n't been heard from since but we keep the staff around just in case 
 george marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy 
 we keep a lot of <unk> to him around the pentagon <unk> <unk> <unk> and such 
 the army headquarters on the third deck of the pentagon used to <unk> a lot of <unk> to him but the navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it 
 you see marshall had this thing about the navy and the <unk> he wanted to make them part of the army but secretary of the navy james <unk> blocked him 
 now his ghost wo n't let up till it 's done 
 to keep him quiet we <unk> a new unified command every year or so run by the army or the air force and put more of the navy and <unk> under it 
 but we still hear him <unk> at night because the navy has a few ships left and to satisfy him the navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new air force bureaucracy in illinois its space operations to another command in colorado the <unk> to a new army bureaucracy in fort <unk> and the navy 's indian ocean and persian gulf forces to an army bureaucracy in florida 
 which brings up the worst and <unk> ghost of all the ghost of the shah of iran 
 when the shah died president carter was so scared that the shah 's ghost would blame him for <unk> him out to make way for the <unk> that he declared the carter doctrine 
 mr. carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab iran 
 but that ghost would n't settle for words he wanted money and people lots 
 so mr. carter formed three new army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in tampa called the rapid <unk> force 
 but that ghost was n't <unk> he knew the <unk> was neither rapid nor <unk> nor a force even though it cost $ N billion or $ N billion a year 
 after mr. carter was defeated in N the shah 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after president reagan and cap <unk> 
 i saw what he did to them <unk> 
 it made my <unk> dance with <unk> 
 why he used to lay in wait for cap suddenly he 'd leap from behind some <unk> of marshall onto cap 's <unk> and grab him by the <unk> and <unk> him till he <unk> up an additional $ N billion or so 
 cap added four more divisions to the army two active and two reserve two carrier groups to the navy a division equivalent to the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a thousand tactical aircraft to the air force 
 he bought $ N billion in <unk> ships and $ N billion in <unk> and equipment to fill them and <unk> them at a new $ N billion base at diego garcia in the middle of the indian ocean 
 he dedicated all these new forces to the persian gulf 
 one night both marshall 's ghost and the shah 's ghost together caught cap and threw him to the ground 
 before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the <unk> in tampa and renamed it central command 
 he gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the persian gulf and indian ocean 
 marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers someday maybe they would get the whole navy 
 they had fun moving the carriers around but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine <unk> 
 but the shah still kept leaping out at cap so cap bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ N billion of <unk> <unk> <unk> etc. in order that those seven new army divisions and three marine <unk> could unload from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the <unk> <unk> 
 then suddenly <unk> 's ghost came to visit and said what the hell are you doing planning for a land war in asia N miles away 
 we 'd get our <unk> kicked 
 lucky for cap <unk> was <unk> and soon went away while the shah he kept coming back 
 so the u.s. found itself paying about $ N billion in <unk> to various arab <unk> for <unk> rights around the indian ocean 
 we had great success in somalia 
 but then it turned out that president <unk> <unk> was not at all a nice person and the navy pointed out that the base he promised us in <unk> had <unk> up about a hundred years ago and anyway was N miles from the mouth of the gulf 
 but who 's counting 
 still <unk> was the best we could get so we stay in bed with president <unk> 
 all these reports about him committing <unk> are probably <unk> anyway 
 but would n't you know now that we are spending <unk> of dollars and have built those new divisions and new air wings and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the russians in iran the russians seem to have lost interest in the whole subject 
 meanwhile congress is cutting huge chunks out of the rest of the defense budget 
 predictably some navy guys said do we still need to keep all N army divisions on active duty and all those extra <unk> aircraft without bases and all those army guys playing <unk> in tampa 
 could n't we save $ N billion or $ N billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves 
 and why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by <unk> central command and putting responsibility for gulf naval operations back where it belongs afloat with the task force <unk> in the gulf 
 and where were all our <unk> paid indian ocean allies last year when our <unk> were being attacked 
 questions like that really stir up marshall 's ghost 
 he appeared late one night in the <unk> of the new defense secretary dick cheney 
 marshall came <unk> in like <unk> 's ghost dragging those chains of <unk> and air wings and links with arab <unk> 
 he would n't leave until mr. cheney promised to do whatever the pentagon systems analysts told him 
 so next day mr. cheney went out and did just that he canceled the <unk> navy and cut back one carrier and N <unk> 
 then he canceled production of the navy 's most important carrier aircraft the f-14 and the <unk> 
 on the other hand mr. cheney retained all those new land forces 
 marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now but he 'll be back 
 what with halloween coming and bigger defense cuts looming more and more pentagon bureaucrats are <unk> under their desks 
 they know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships 
 then the whole thing will start to collapse just as it did in the 1970s and the ghosts and <unk> will be <unk> through the place turning people 's hair white 
 gives me the <unk> just thinking about it 
 mr. lehman a reagan navy secretary is a managing director of painewebber 
 the metal and marble lobby of centrust bank 's headquarters is <unk> than your average savings and loan 
 for one thing there is an old master on the wall samuel <unk> david a big <unk> <unk> painted by <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> 
 at the moment however the painting is a nagging reminder of the problems that have <unk> centrust and its flamboyant chairman and chief executive david l. paul 
 in an international buying spree that began barely two years ago mr. paul <unk> a collection of about N <unk> works including the <unk> at a total cost of $ N million 
 by midnight oct. N all of the paintings were supposed to have been sold off under orders from florida 's comptroller whose office <unk> the state 's s&ls 
 centrust did n't meet the deadline 
 the collection was at the heart of a <unk> plan mr. paul had in which the art was to do double duty as an investment for centrust and as <unk> for the s&l 's new office tower designed by <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> is that the $ N million was <unk> from the funds of this federally insured institution even as centrust was losing money hand over <unk> 
 mr. paul had no right to buy art for the s&l in the first place it is n't on the comptroller 's permissible list without seeking a special <unk> which he did not do 
 besides that some of the paintings that were to grace the walls of centrust actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on la <unk> <unk> off miami beach 
 last spring the comptroller 's office called a halt to mr. paul 's <unk> giving him six months to sell the paintings 
 the acquisitions officials said in a letter to mr. paul were <unk> <unk> and unauthorized 
 so far mr. paul has <unk> but three of his <unk> he wo n't say to whom 
 the comptroller 's office says it is monitoring the situation 
 though the agency could remove mr. paul it has no current intention to do that 
 it 's not like selling <unk> mr. paul says as he takes a drag on a <unk> st. <unk> cigarette 
 the last six months has established the quality of the collection 
 there 's no fire sale here 
 despite mr. paul 's characteristic <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is finding that getting centrust florida 's largest thrift institution out of its <unk> investments is much tougher than getting into them had been 
 paintings are just part of the picture 
 although mr. paul has <unk> a $ N billion junk-bond portfolio to less than $ N million since april the high-yield debt market has plummeted 
 <unk> itself of what is left as is required of all thrift institutions by july N under the new federal s&l bailout law may well prove difficult 
 and centrust has other problems 
 late last week federal regulators ordered the thrift institution to stop paying dividends on its preferred stock a move that suggests deep concern about an institution 
 mr. paul has a plan to bring in $ N million by selling off N of centrust 's N branches but it has yet to be approved by regulators 
 it is mr. paul 's art venture however that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators not to mention <unk> throughout the world 
 <unk> shareholders some of whom are suing say the chairman and his collection <unk> the excesses of speculation that set off the national s&l crisis 
 centrust shares have fallen sharply in price from a high of $ N in N to close yesterday at $ N 
 gallery directors meanwhile say mr. paul and others of his <unk> have left an <unk> mark on the art world and not for the better 
 collectors do n't say it 's a van <unk> anymore <unk> harry brooks the president of <unk> & co. a new york gallery 
 they say <unk> <unk> got $ N million for his so certainly $ N million is n't too much for mine 
 the great collectors we depended on such as paul mellon or norton simon have stopped buying and the new buyers are brilliant men who made money in the stock market or in takeovers and rushed into collecting 
 mr. <unk> an art dealer and <unk> sold vincent van <unk> 's <unk> at a sotheby 's auction in november N to australian businessman alan bond 
 trouble is mr. bond has yet to pay up and until he does sotheby 's has the painting under lock and key 
 when mr. paul moved in on the art market he let it be known that virtually no piece was too costly to be considered by centrust 
 he established his reputation as a <unk> in january last year at sotheby 's auction of the linda and gerald guterman collection in new york 
 there on one of his first shopping trips mr. paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices 
 he paid $ N million for instance for a still life by jan <unk> <unk> <unk> that was expected to fetch perhaps $ N 
 the price paid was a record for the artist 
 some N N of items offered at the guterman auction were sold at an average price of $ N 
 the rest were withdrawn for lack of acceptable bids 
 afterward mr. paul is said by mr. guterman to have <unk> mr. guterman the new york developer selling the collection and <unk> 
 he says he <unk> them recalls mr. guterman 
 and he tells me if you want to see your paintings you 'll have to come to my house in florida 
 mr. paul denies <unk> and <unk> 
 it 's just not true he says 
 mr. paul quickly became more aggressive in his collecting with the help of george wachter a sotheby 's expert in old masters whom he met at an exhibition of the guterman items 
 mr. wachter who became his principal adviser searched <unk> in london paris and <unk> 
 and according to one dealer mr. wachter had a <unk> for introducing mr. paul with the phrase he can buy anything 
 nicholas hall the president of the <unk> u.s.a. ltd. gallery in new york sold mr. paul <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> by giovanni <unk> <unk> 
 mr. hall says mr. paul was known to spend a lot of money 
 people were interested in seeing him but it was recognized that the route was through sotheby 's and particularly george wachter 
 mr. paul thus developed a close <unk> relationship with sotheby 's 
 mr. paul was eager to <unk> a collection for the headquarters centrust has been moving into for the greater part of a year 
 sotheby 's the auction house founded in london N and now under the <unk> of sotheby 's holdings inc. was hoping to stir up interest in old masters as it <unk> to build its u.s. business 
 european dealers continued to dominate the action in old masters which sotheby 's north america had lately been touting in this country 
 for several months there was optimism all around 
 last october mr. paul paid out $ N million of centrust 's cash plus a $ N million commission for portrait of a man as <unk> 
 the painting attributed to <unk> artist peter paul rubens was purchased privately through sotheby 's not at auction 
 in march N just N months into his campaign mr. paul was named by art & <unk> magazine as one of the top N individual collectors in the u.s. 
 an unknown quantity to most of the art world paul is no <unk> to <unk> spending the magazine said noting that he does n't stop at <unk> on <unk> but also spends big on art you can eat 
 he recently bid $ N at a paris charity auction for a dinner <unk> by six of the world 's great chefs but the final party cost closer to $ N 
 mr. paul says it was n't that high 
 the art collection might have come to rival the <unk> ' had the florida comptroller 's office not got wind of mr. paul 's <unk> <unk> 
 in its letter to him dated march N and shared with reporters alex <unk> the chief of the <unk> bureau in the comptroller 's office expressed <unk> that the s&l could be so <unk> when it had reported losses of more than $ N million in its two preceding quarters 
 the state gave centrust N days to sell the rubens 
 the comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but <unk> its demands ordering that the book value of the collection be reduced to zero 
 in other words get rid of all the pictures 
 the state <unk> noted that <unk> banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the <unk> to mr. paul govern yourself <unk> 
 the state agency was particularly <unk> to learn that the rubens and a <unk> other paintings listed among the bank 's furniture and <unk> were actually hanging in the chairman 's house 
 mr. paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at sotheby 's 
 he explains that he was merely <unk> the paintings at home with some display because of the special <unk> environment required for their <unk> until centrust 's new building was ready for them 
 still the incident was embarrassing 
 it came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that mr. paul has benefited <unk> from his association with centrust 
 for instance he got a $ N million loan from the s&l negotiated at a <unk> rate 
 he owns N N of centrust 's shares 
 adding to mr. paul 's problems dealers some with vested interests insist that he relying rather too heavily on sotheby 's advice paid much too much for several pieces in the centrust collection 
 the $ N million <unk> on the rubens for example was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value given a dispute among scholars about its <unk> 
 david <unk> the president of david <unk> inc. a new york gallery says scholars question the <unk> of the rubens 
 it may have been painted instead by a rubens associate 
 the feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event mr. <unk> says 
 it sounds like with the rubens he got absolutely taken to the <unk> 
 victor <unk> the executive director of the <unk> association of america agrees that mr. paul paid very <unk> for the rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat 
 it 's not beyond credibility the rubens will someday be worth $ N million but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen 
 still predicting is tricky 
 i 'm forever <unk> by what i see making these high prices 
 jonathan h. <unk> the son of the painting 's former owner mrs. rush <unk> <unk> the price talk as sour <unk> 
 dealers <unk> of the purchase price he says were themselves interested in buying the rubens but lost out 
 mr. paul for his part <unk> the rubens price saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself 
 most of them were n't even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly he says 
 art prices are <unk> but a good deal of <unk> is involved in <unk> statistics on sales 
 salomon brothers inc. the investment-banking firm in its annual tally of investment returns reported that old masters <unk> N N in the year ended june N the greatest return of any of N assets it tracked 
 <unk> and modern paintings not tracked by salomon are ranked even higher at N N by sotheby 's 
 salomon moreover gets its data on art appreciation from sotheby 's whose prices go up with clients like mr. paul in its <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> from consideration the many paintings that go <unk> at auction 
 art indexes track winners not losers 
 but art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale 
 also at any of sotheby 's auctions of old masters roughly one-third to <unk> of what is offered does n't sell at any price 
 it 's not that there are n't any bids but the bids do n't meet the minimum reserve prices set by the sellers 
 in january the <unk> painting that now hangs at centrust was expected to bring no more than $ N at auction until mr. paul came along with his $ N million 
 mr. hall of the <unk> gallery says $ N million would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a <unk> four years ago 
 but from his <unk> point it is n't that mr. paul a customer of his too <unk> for the work a <unk> painting by an artist who is not a household word 
 the painting is N feet wide seven feet high 
 rather it just shows things have changed 
 mr. paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn 
 they went up N N last year and they 'll do it again this year he declares 
 they were a <unk> 
 everybody was out buying <unk> 
 sotheby 's vice president <unk> <unk> says the auction house has been <unk> mr. paul in selling the paintings 
 and while sotheby 's chief rivals in the art world private art dealers wo n't be happy to hear it she adds a number of the <unk> have already been sold and at a substantial profit 
 mr. paul claims to have sold three paintings at more than a N N profit 
 that is n't N N and the claim is n't <unk> 
 he furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on sotheby 's or mr. wachter 
 mr. paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid <unk> 
 after all he had the counsel of <unk> from the most reputable <unk> in the world 
 he says he expects to sell the collection including the controversial rubens carefully and <unk> just as it was put together 
 but in <unk> <unk> mr. paul 's holdings are <unk> 
 that is he is being <unk> to put them on the market too soon and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works 
 after a few years you can argue there has been natural appreciation says susan <unk> the publisher of leonard 's annual price index of art auctions 
 but quick turnover in <unk> is like <unk> your jewelry you end up with N N 
 people hold out and try to get a bargain 
 sotheby 's <unk> itself and mr. paul in the matter 
 mr. wachter says mr. paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment 
 on occasion he paid a high price mr. wachter concedes but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to <unk> them at a profit to collectors 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> at <unk> associates in san francisco considers it <unk> conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased 
 sotheby 's she says is wearing both hats 
 i ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest says sotheby 's ms. <unk> 
 estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be 
 frequently clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding she adds so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be 
 mr. paul in selling off his paintings is seeking at least a N N return on the bank 's investment so as to prove that the venture was sound 
 mr. paul says that he has <unk> out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as japan and italy have examined the collection 
 because of the pressure on centrust to sell dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at <unk> prices 
 but so far mr. paul and his advisers are holding fast 
 one dealer martin <unk> of french & co. in new york says he would have loved to buy a jan <unk> de <unk> painting from the bank 
 i tried to steal the picture to buy it <unk> and sotheby 's would n't do it 
 they were protecting his interests 
 meanwhile mr. paul and centrust executives are getting <unk> about <unk> 
 mr. paul has been characterized as the great <unk> or something complains karen e. <unk> an executive vice president of centrust 
 the media she says have distorted his personal life 
 mr. paul <unk> in agreement 
 i do n't think i have a life style that is frankly so flamboyant he says 
 but at just that moment he is interrupted in his office by a <unk> in <unk> who <unk> coffee from silver into a cup of china and <unk> the <unk> with <unk> 
 mr. paul says yes the ceiling in his executive <unk> is <unk> <unk> 
 the offices are done in <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> books and of course a $ N million rubens 
 but he <unk> that the <unk> be played down 
 do n't say it 's a gold ceiling 
 just say the offices are <unk> appointed he says 
 otherwise the regulators will take it for <unk> and <unk> everything 's got to be <unk> 
 figures do n't include taxes or transaction costs 
 companies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates

 creative accounting mostly by <unk> forced <unk> to change their way of setting standards to be followed by corporations reporting financial results standards that had become all too flexible 
 the new financial accounting standards board fasb was created in N to replace the accounting principles board of the american institute of certified public accountants 
 all of the former board 's members were <unk> <unk> <unk> criticism because they were writing rules while handling clients ' books at the same time

 the former board had produced N opinions and N critics in its 12-year life its chairman had conceded 
 the climate was right for the new fasb 
 in the late 1960s some <unk> failed to correct such abuses as clients picking <unk> rules that <unk> earnings and stock prices 
 and in november N congress had passed a special act to <unk> one board rule 
 also james needham an sec commissioner in april N had warned that the industry might face a federal agency writing accounting rules if they rejected the fasb idea

 the turmoil on wall street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains investment bankers and retailers said 
 managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies 
 the chains include bloomingdale 's owned by campeau corp. toronto saks fifth avenue and marshall field 's owned by b.a.t industries plc london and b. altman & co. and <unk> inc. owned by hooker corp. which is now being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> 
 hooker is based in sydney australia 
 the combination of so many chains available for sale the recent failures of such retailing lbo 's as miller & <unk> inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices retailing observers said 
 the pricing will become more realistic which should help management said bruce rosenthal a new york investment banker with nathan s. <unk> & co 
 investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed lbos but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense either 
 earlier this year bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales mr. rosenthal added 
 those days are over now he believes 
 competition from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue added mr. rosenthal 
 but when prices were crazy it was even harder to do an lbo 
 bankers believed in the <unk> theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more 
 this is no longer true today 
 at saks fifth avenue paul <unk> senior vice president marketing agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed lbo 
 having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage said mr. <unk> 
 it would also help us in our search for equity partners 
 to make an lbo work now we are going to need more than just junk bonds 
 none believe the proposed management lbos will be easy to complete especially at b. altman & co. which is under chapter N bankruptcy protection 
 not only could the wall street gyrations damp christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger <unk> and greater management equity participation 
 further many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be <unk> to consider additional retailing investments 
 it 's called bad money driving out good money said one retailing <unk> 
 institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned 
 however the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt 
 in addition the fall selling season has generally been a good one especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues 
 what 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings not liquidation values said joseph e. brooks chairman and chief executive officer of ann taylor inc. a specialty chain 
 retailers who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies 
 still most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing lbos will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds a market already in <unk> in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the federated and allied units of campeau 
 prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week which will help management said <unk> harrison chairman of <unk> inc. an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions 
 but the hurdle of financing still has to be resolved 
 potential bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past

 a federal appeals court struck down a natural-gas regulation that had prevented pipeline companies from passing to customers part of $ N billion in costs from controversial <unk> contracts 
 the court in a N ruling threw out a deadline set by the federal energy regulatory commission for settling old contract disputes over gas that the pipeline companies reserved but did n't use 
 ferc 's regulation had given pipelines until march N N to pass on to customers as much as N N of the costs of buying out their broken contracts which were made with producers when gas prices were high and supplies short 
 a majority of old contracts were <unk> by the deadline and settled at steep discounts 
 but pipeline companies estimate they still face $ N billion in liabilities from <unk> disputes including $ N billion they fear they wo n't be able to pass on to customers 
 according to industry lawyers the ruling gives pipeline companies an important second chance to resolve remaining disputes and take advantage of the cost-sharing mechanism 
 the court left open whether ferc could <unk> a new deadline later 
 the court agreeing with pipeline companies found the march N deadline was <unk> and <unk> and highly <unk> to the bargaining power of pipelines that were forced to negotiate settlement of the old <unk> contracts to meet the deadline 
 a report last month by the interstate natural gas association of america found that pipelines ' settlement costs had jumped in the three months before the deadline to N cents on the dollar from N cents on the dollar in N 
 the court ordered ferc to justify within N days not only its cost-sharing deadline but other major elements of its proposed regulation for introducing more competition into natural-gas transportation 
 the court also questioned a <unk> mechanism that could be used to resolve <unk> liabilities 
 the complex regulation known in the industry as order N has been <unk> contested by all sides including natural-gas producers pipelines local distribution companies and consumers 
 the court 's decision would allow ferc to change some of its provisions but <unk> it will be reviewed again quickly by the court
